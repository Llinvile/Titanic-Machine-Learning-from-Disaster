# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

---
This project applies machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on demographic and travel data. It was completed as part of the Kaggle competition "Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster," one of the most popular beginner challenges.

---
## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict passenger survival using classification models.
- Apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
- Compare model performance to select the most effective approach.

---
## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees)

---
## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data exploration and visualisation.
2. Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
3. Feature engineering (e.g., extracting titles from names, family size).
4. Model training and evaluation using accuracy and ROC-AUC.

---
## ✅ Results
- Achieved [insert score] accuracy on Kaggle public leaderboard.
- Demonstrated understanding of end-to-end ML workflow.
